# Algorithm_Study
Me working through understanding how famous/important algorithms work.

Things I intend to include:
<li>Graph representation of algorithm</li>
<li>Explanations, as far as I can, for the principles of the algorithm</li>
<li>Mathematical Analysis</li>
<li>Basic implementations in multiple languages (i.e. Python, C++, Javascript, etc)</li>
